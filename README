This is a syntax file for AutoIt v3, available from http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/.

This is an updated version of Riccardo Casini's original script:

Version 1.5 is included with the official Vim distribution beginning with version 7.1, but I will continue to update the syntax file as necessary for future versions of AutoIt.  These updates, along with change details, will be posted here.
